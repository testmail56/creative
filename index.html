Creative process : While working on a college project, I noticed our team usually completed all features before starting testing. This often created pressure near deadlines, and even small issues became difficult to fix. I felt this approach increased stress and risk, so I thought about improving the process. I suggested checking each feature soon after it was finished rather than waiting until everything was done .To explain this idea, I spoke with my teammates in a clear and friendly way and shared how early testing could save effort and reduce tension later. I also tried this method on my own part of the project to see if it truly helped. When the team saw that problems were being found sooner and fixes were quicker, they agreed to follow the same routine .In the end, our work became more structured, and tracking progress was easier. We also felt calmer before submission. This small change helped us deliver a stronger project and boosted our confidence as a group.
